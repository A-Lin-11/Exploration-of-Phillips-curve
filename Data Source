Data Source

I will use the data sets from world bank with the world bank API:

Unemployment, total (% of total labor force) (modeled ILO estimate)
http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.UEM.TOTL.ZS

This data set provides the annual unemployment rate for all the countries and economies from year 1960 to 2016. 
Most of the countries do not have records for the early year, and most have not reported the latest figure (2016). 
The data are in percentage. The number of regions is 264, and the number of years is 57.

Inflation, consumer prices (annual %) (1960-2015)
http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG

This data set provides the annual inflation rate for all the countries and economies from year 1960 to 2016, using the CPI method. 
Most of the countries do not have records for the early year, and most have not reported the latest figure (2016). 
The data are also in percentage. The number of regions is 264, and the number of years is 57.

These two datasets are open to use without restrictions.
I will use the world bank API to get the json feed of the data. 
There’s a module in python called ‘wbdata’ that is convenient in accessing the API data (https://github.com/OliverSherouse/wbdata). 
The module can directly take in the json feed and convert them into a pandas dataframe, which is the final outcome, with the countries as rows and the years as columns.
